# Account Setup
- In  the first step, I'd created Microsoft Azure account using email address that university provoded me.

- Then I got  to know about the cloud and its importance. 

- Additionally, I explored student benefits and open an student account and Azure give me *$100* worth of credits that I can use to purchase any package within the environment.


# Create Virtual Machine
- I created virtual machine where I have to work later on this course.

- Then I select Marketplace from *Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS gen 2 Server* published by Canonical. 

- I named my machine *"rubi-robotics"*.

- I choose B series version 2 which is *Standard_B2ls_v2*.

- Later, I create a new resource group for the machine and subnet to place the machine in.

# Link my HAMK email to my GitHub account

- I create a new repository named *"linux"* for the assignment.

- Then I add my HAMK email as a secondary mail for version control.
